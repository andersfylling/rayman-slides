# rayman-slides

An open-source 2D side-scrolling platformer inspired by the classic Rayman 1 (1995), developed using Claude Code.

## About

This project recreates the gameplay and feel of Rayman 1 using entirely custom, AI-generated assets. No original game data is used—all sprites, music, and level designs are original creations that evoke the whimsical fairy-tale aesthetic of the source material.

### Key Features
- Limbless character with progressive ability unlocks (telescopic fist, grappling, helicopter hair, running)
- 6 thematic worlds mixing natural and imaginary landscapes
- Collectible-based progression (free all caged creatures to unlock the final world)
- Boss battles at the end of each world
- Swappable "Profiles" (asset packs) for different visual themes

### Why "Slides"?
The project uses a "profile" system allowing different skins/asset packs to slide in and out, keeping the core mechanics while enabling visual customization.

## Tech Stack
- Go
- Multiple rendering backends: Terminal (ASCII), CPU software renderer, Vulkan
