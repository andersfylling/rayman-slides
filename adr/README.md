# Architectural Decision Records

Short documents capturing key architectural decisions for the project.

## Format

Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`

Example: `2025-12-27-terminal-rendering.md`

## Template

```markdown
# Title

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [link]

## Context

What's the situation? (2-3 sentences max)

## Decision

What did we decide? (Be specific)

## Consequences

What are the trade-offs? (Bullet points)
```

## Guidelines

- **Keep it short** - If it's longer than a page, split it up
- **One decision per ADR** - Don't bundle unrelated choices
- **Link related ADRs** - Reference previous decisions when relevant
- **Date prefix** - Use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for natural sorting
- **No fluff** - Skip obvious pros/cons, focus on non-obvious trade-offs
